## DNAICI: Differential Network Analysis in Intra-chromosomal Community Interaction

:lock: [DEMO](https://github.com/differential-network-analysis/dnaici/tree/master/demo)

Multi-omics datasets from chromosomes 18 and 19 in both untreated MCF7 cells and tamoxifen-resistant MCF7TR cells:
* Hi-C
* Microarray and RNA-seq of gene expression
* DNase-seq and ATAC-Seq of nucleosome density
* ChIP-Seq of markers for enhancer (H3K27ac and H3K4me1), promoter (H3K4me3), repressor (H3K27me3 and H3K9me3), and insulator (CTCF)

:key: [DNAICI](https://github.com/differential-network-analysis/dnaici/tree/master/dnaici)

Three main modules are included in DNAICI package for analyzing multi-omics data:
* preprocess
* analysis
* parameter
